# complexity-practice

An exercise in analyzing complexity, writing efficient methods, and choosing appropriate data structures.

## Setup
Have 1 partner fork the repository, then invite the other as a collaborator.
Both partners should clone the same fork and open it on VS Code.

WORK ON EACH PROBLEM TOGETHER! DO NOT "DIVIDE AND CONQUER"

All your work will be done in Main.java.

Follow the instructions given in the comments above each method. The type of tasks will be:
- Determining the time complexity of a method
- Rewriting a method to be more efficient
- Determining which data structure would be best to use in a given scenario.

## Submission
Please create a PR against the original repository. BOTH PARTNERS submit a link to the sam PR on Canvas.
